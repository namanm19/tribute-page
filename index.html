            <h3>Here's a time line of Milkha Singh Ji</h3>
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Milkha Singh was born on 20 November 1929.</li>
                <li>He was born in a Sikh family of Rathore Rajput origin. His birthplace was Govindpura, a village 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) from Muzaffargarh city in Punjab Province, British India (now Muzaffargarh District, Pakistan).</li>
                <li>He was one of 15 siblings, eight of whom died before the Partition of India.</li>
                <li>He was orphaned during the Partition when his parents, a brother and two sisters were killed in the violence that ensued. He witnessed these killings.</li>
                <li>Singh represented India in the 200m and 400m competitions of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games.</li>
                <li>In 1958, Singh set records for the 200m and 400m in the National Games of India, held at Cuttack, and also won gold medals in the same events at the Asian Games.</li>
                <li>He then won a gold medal in the 400m (440 yards at this time) competition at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games with a time of 46.6 seconds.</li>
                <li>This latter achievement made him the first gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games from independent India.</li>
                <li>Before Vikas Gowda won the gold in 2014, Milkha was the only Indian male to have won an individual athletics gold medal at those Games.</li>
                <li>Singh was admitted to the intensive care unit at Fortis Hospital in Mohali on 24 May 2021 with pneumonia caused by COVID-19. His condition was, for a while, described as stable, but he died on 18 June 2021 at 11:30 pm in Chandigarh.</li>
            </ul>
            <i>"Singh was persuaded by Jawaharlal Nehru to set aside his memories of the Partition era to race successfully in 1960 against Abdul Khaliq in Pakistan."</i><br><br>
            <i>- By Indian prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru</i>
